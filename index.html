          <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is a collection of my school activities, reflections, and experiences. It was made to organize my work in one place, so it is easier to share and look back on everything I have done.</p>
          <p>Here, you will find different activities that I completed in class. Each one includes a short description of what the task was about and a reflection where I explain what I learned from it. This way, the portfolio is not only a record of my work but also a record of my growth as a student.</p>
          <p>The portfolio is arranged in a way that makes it simple to explore. You can go through the activities one by one, just like browsing through a collection. Each section tells a story about my progress—what I was asked to do, how I responded, and what lessons I took with me afterward.</p>
          <p>This portfolio is more than just a requirement for school. It also serves as a guide for me to see how much I have improved and what I still need to work on. It shows how I am slowly building my knowledge, skills, and character, step by step, as I continue my studies.</p>
          <p>Feel free to explore and read through my activities and reflections. I hope this portfolio gives you a clear picture of my journey as a student and how I am working toward my goals.</p>

      <h3>Activity Description</h3>
      <p>This discussion forum asked us to reflect on two questions: "Why did you choose Southville?" and "What are your expectations for this class?"</p>
      <blockquote><b>1. Why did you choose Southville?</b><br>I chose Southville because it has always been my dream school. I’ve admired the uniform for a long time; it really suits my style. On a practical note, Southville is also the closest school to my home, which makes commuting much more convenient and less of a hassle. And lastly, I believe Southville offers a quality education since it is an international school with a good academic reputation.<br><br><b>2. What are my expectations for this class?</b><br>I hope to have a meaningful learning experience this semester. I look forward to gaining new knowledge. I also hope the class will be enjoyable, not too stressful or overwhelming, something a bit more relaxed and fun, while still being productive and engaging.</blockquote>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Participating in this discussion forum gave me the chance to look back at why I am here in Southville and what I truly want to achieve in this class. Writing my answer helped me realize that my decision to study here was not just based on convenience, but also on admiration, values, and trust in the school’s quality education. It reminded me that I am in the right place to grow, both academically and personally.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on my expectations also helped me set the tone for the semester. I realized that while I want to challenge myself and gain new knowledge, I also value a learning environment that is balanced—fun, interactive, and engaging, without being overly stressful. This shows that I am aware of my own learning style: I do best when I feel comfortable, motivated, and connected to my classmates and professors.</p>
      <p>Through this activity, I also saw how important it is to have clear goals and a positive outlook at the start of a course. By knowing what I want from this class, I can stay focused and make the most out of every lesson. It also motivated me to actively participate, not just as a student who listens, but as someone who contributes to making the class atmosphere enjoyable for everyone.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Answering the needs assessment made me more aware of the areas in my life that need improvement. By reflecting on my answers, I realized that many of my struggles are connected, such as lack of sleep leading to tiredness, which then affects my focus on academics. My personal shyness also makes it harder for me to engage in class and build confidence when speaking in front of others.</p>
      <p>At first, I felt nervous about being honest in the form, but I understood that it was meant to help me, not judge me. By sharing my challenges, I opened the door to possible support from teachers, counselors, and mentors.</p>
      <p>This activity taught me that it is okay to recognize and admit weaknesses because it is the first step to self-growth. I also realized that shyness and fear of making mistakes are normal, but they can be overcome through practice, self-confidence, and guidance.</p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>Completing the TOWPEP Questionnaire made me realize the importance of self-assessment and self-awareness. By rating myself, I was able to see how I value qualities like honesty, perseverance, gratitude, and responsibility. I noticed that I often strive to give my best in every task, show respect to others, and remain truthful even in difficult situations.</p>
  <p>This reflection gave me a sense of pride because it showed that I am aware of my personal strengths. At the same time, it reminded me that there is always room for growth. For example, while I scored myself high in adaptability and perseverance, I know that real-life challenges may test these traits, and I must continue to practice them in different situations.</p>
  <p>Another insight I gained is that personal effectiveness is not only about academic performance but also about character and attitude. It is about how I treat others, how I manage challenges, and how I stay true to my values. This activity encouraged me to keep nurturing these qualities so I can be more resilient, compassionate, and effective both in school and in life.</p>

          <li>I can feel lost when my routine is disrupted, craving familiar structure.</li>
          <li>I am vulnerable to disappointment and can be hurt when my trust is misplaced.</li>
          <li>I look to others for guidance when facing new challenges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Part 2: Personal Reflection</h2>
          <h3>1. What does Psalm 23 mean to you?</h3>
          <p>To me, Psalm 23 is about trusting that I'm being looked after, especially when I feel completely lost and drained. It reminds me that I don't have to carry every burden myself. It impacts my hardest days, when my anxiety is high and my heart feels heavy, by telling me it's okay to rest and believe I’ll be guided to peace of mind.</p>
          <h3>2. Which line struck you the most? Why?</h3>
          <p>The line that strikes me is, <em>"he leads me beside quiet waters."</em> My mind is always racing, and the idea of a place of pure calm feels like the relief I’ve been searching for.</p>
          <h3>3. Am I a Shepherd or a Sheep?</h3>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Sheep – I rely on my parents for guidance and support.</p>
          <p><strong>Friends:</strong> Shepherd – I look out for everyone and keep our circle strong.</p>
          <p><strong>Studies:</strong> Shepherd – I set goals and discipline myself to succeed.</p>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Sheep – Anxiety sometimes makes me uncertain, but I’m learning to guide myself better.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
          <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
          <p>Psalm 23 reminds me that I am never truly alone, even in moments when life feels confusing or heavy. It teaches me that I don’t have to carry everything on my own, because there is always guidance and comfort available. The part that says, <em>“he leads me beside quiet waters”</em> speaks deeply to me, because my mind is often restless with worries. It gives me hope that peace and calmness are possible if I learn to trust and let go.</p>
          <p>When I think about myself as both a Shepherd and a Sheep, Psalm 23 makes even more sense. As a Shepherd, I show leadership, loyalty, patience, and care for the people around me. I like to guide, support, and stand by those who need me. But as a Sheep, I also recognize my own weaknesses—I get easily affected by others, I rely on my family and mentors for guidance, and I sometimes feel lost when faced with new challenges.</p>
          <p>This balance between being a Shepherd and a Sheep reminds me that life is about both giving and receiving. There are times when I am strong enough to lead, and there are times when I need to follow and trust others. Psalm 23 comforts me because it assures me that whether I am leading or following, I am still being guided and cared for. It teaches me to accept both roles with humility, courage, and faith.</p>

      <h3>Activity Description</h3>
      <p>This discussion forum was about sharing how I apply the 5S principles—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain—in my daily tasks as a student assistant in the office.</p>
      <blockquote>As a student assistant in the office, I practice the 5S in many ways that help me work better and keep the workplace organized. For <b>sort</b>, I separate documents carefully by putting the old files in archives and keeping the new and updated ones in a place where they are easy to access. For <b>set in order</b>, I always return things to their proper place after using them. For <b>shine</b>, I make it a habit to clean the office not only before leaving but also during office hours and even upon arrival. For <b>standardize</b>, I follow routines like submitting tasks early and finishing work before the deadline. Lastly, for <b>sustain</b>, I remind myself to continue practicing all these habits daily, because being consistent and disciplined helps the office stay organized, efficient, and professional.</blockquote>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Through this discussion forum, I realized how much the 5S principles shape the way I work and manage my responsibilities. As a student assistant, applying 5S has helped me develop a sense of discipline, order, and professionalism. It made me understand that small, consistent habits—like keeping documents organized and cleaning regularly—have a big impact on productivity.</p>
      <p>I also reflected that 5S is not just about cleaning or organizing physical spaces. It is also about training the mind and character. For example, sorting files teaches me decision-making, while sustaining routines builds self-discipline and reliability. Practicing these principles has made me more efficient, not only in the office but also in my studies, because I learned how to manage my time and finish tasks without procrastination.</p>

    <div class="details-content">
        <h3>Reflection on the 5C’s</h3>
        <h4>1. Character</h4>
        <p>For me, character means the values and attitudes that guide the way I live and interact with others. In school and in my personal life, I always try to practice honesty, respect, and kindness. For example, as a student assistant, I make sure to be reliable with tasks and respectful to the people I work with. I also value discipline, like organizing documents properly and cleaning the office, because it shows responsibility and respect for the workplace.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on my character made me realize that these small habits—such as being honest in answering the Online Needs Assessment or being truthful in the TOWPEP Questionnaire—help build trust and integrity. Having good character is important because it is the foundation of everything else. Skills and knowledge may change, but values stay with you and guide your decisions in life.</p>
        <h4>2. Competence</h4>
        <p>Competence is about being capable and having the knowledge and skills to do tasks well. In my journey as a BSIT student, I am still building my competence step by step. I may not know everything yet, but I show competence by finishing my assignments, learning new tools, and applying lessons in practical ways. For example, when I reflected on Psalm 23, I learned to connect values to real life, showing competence not only in academics but also in deeper understanding.</p>
        <p>I also see competence in how I apply the 5S principles in my work as a student assistant—sorting, organizing, cleaning, and sustaining order. These habits may seem simple, but they show that I can handle responsibilities effectively. Competence is not just about grades; it is about doing your best and being prepared to grow more each day.</p>
        <h4>3. Commitment</h4>
        <p>Commitment means being dedicated and consistent in what I do, even when it gets difficult. I show commitment by taking my studies seriously and by being responsible with my duties, whether in class or in the office. When I joined the discussion forums, I reflected honestly on why I chose Southville and what I expect from my classes. This shows my commitment to make the most out of my education and to stay motivated despite challenges.</p>
        <p>I also see commitment in how I keep practicing habits like cleaning, organizing, and finishing tasks early. It’s not always easy to stay disciplined, especially when I feel tired or shy, but my commitment reminds me of my goals. If I stay consistent now, I know I’ll be more prepared for bigger responsibilities in the future.</p>
        <h4>4. Creativity</h4>
        <p>Creativity has always been one of my strengths. Even before college, I enjoyed designing pages and creating visuals. Now that I am studying IT, I want to use my creativity not just in art but also in programming and development. Creativity helps me think of new ways to solve problems and make tasks more engaging.</p>
        <p>In my reflections, I often try to connect lessons to real life in a personal and meaningful way. For example, when I connected Psalm 23 to my life, I used creativity to express how the verse about “quiet waters” relates to my overthinking and need for peace. Creativity allows me to share my thoughts in ways that are more relatable and easier to understand. It is also important in IT, because technology is not just about coding—it’s also about design, user experience, and innovation.</p>
        <h4>5. Collaboration</h4>
        <p>Collaboration is about working well with others. I admit this is one area I still need to grow in, since I sometimes feel shy or afraid to make mistakes when communicating. In the Online Needs Assessment, I shared that being shy is one of my personal struggles. However, reflecting on it helped me see that collaboration is important if I want to succeed in both school and work.</p>
        <p>As a student assistant, I practice collaboration by helping organize documents, cleaning with others, and making sure tasks are done smoothly as a team. Even if I am quiet at times, I try to support my classmates and coworkers in simple ways, like being reliable and respectful. Collaboration also means listening to others’ ideas, sharing my own when I can, and building trust. I believe that with practice, I can grow more confident in this area and learn to collaborate more actively.</p>
        <h3>🌟 Final Reflection on the 5C’s</h3>
        <p>Looking back at the 5C’s—Character, Competence, Commitment, Creativity, and Collaboration—I realized that they are all connected to my journey as a student and as a person. Character reminds me to live with values, competence pushes me to keep learning, commitment motivates me to stay consistent, creativity inspires me to think differently, and collaboration teaches me the value of teamwork.</p>
        <p>Through my activities and reflections in this portfolio, I can see how I have practiced these 5C’s in different ways. Some areas, like creativity and character, feel natural to me, while others, like collaboration and confidence, are things I still need to improve. But that is the point of reflection—to see where I am strong and where I need growth.</p>
        <p>The 5C’s remind me that education is not only about academics but also about becoming a well-rounded person.</p>

          <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
          <p>My TOWPEP results remind me that I have strong qualities like adaptability, empathy, integrity, perseverance, and a clear sense of purpose. These results give me confidence that I am on the right path, but they also remind me to stay humble and open to learning.</p>
          <p>I realize that being "Very High" in all areas does not mean I am perfect—it means I must use these strengths to help others, keep growing, and manage challenges with balance. I should not only focus on achievements but also on maintaining my wellness and gratitude every day.</p>
          <p>Overall, this reflection motivates me to continue developing both my character and mindset so that I can succeed in my studies, future career, and personal life while staying true to my values.</p>
